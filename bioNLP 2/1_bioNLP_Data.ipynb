Status and Perspectives for Tissue Engineering in Urology.\\n\\nElcin Huseyn\\nAzerbaijan State Oil and Industry\\nUniversity, Baku, Azerbaijan\\n\\nelcin.huseyn@asoiu.edu.az\\n\\nAbstract: Tissue engineering technology and tissue cell-based stem cell research have made\\ngreat strides in treating tissue and organ damage, correcting tissue and organ dysfunction, and\\nreducing surgical complications. In the past, traditional methods have used biological substitutes for\\ntissue repair materials, while tissue engineering technology has focused on merging sperm cells\\nwith biological materials to form biological tissues with the same structure and function as their\\nown tissues. The advantage is that tissue engineering technology can overcome donors. Material\\nprocurement restrictions can effectively reduce complications. The aim of studying tissue\\nengineering technology is to find sperm cells and suitable biological materials to replace the\\noriginal biological functions of tissues and to establish a suitable in vivo microenvironment. This\\narticle mainly describes the current developments of tissue engineering in various fields of urology\\nand discusses the future trends of tissue engineering technology in the treatment of complex\\ndiseases of the urinary system. The results of the research in this article indicate that while the\\ncurrent clinical studies are relatively few, the good results from existing animal model studies\\nindicate good prospects of tissue engineering technology for the treatment of various urinary tract\\ndiseases in the future.\\n\\nKeywords: Tissue engineering; kidney; ureter; bladder; urethra.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nUrinary system tissue damage and organ loss caused by degenerative diseases, trauma or tumors\\nhave always been problems that urology needs to solve. In the past, autologous tissues were used to\\nreplace them, such as genital skin, bladder mucosa, oral mucosa, etc., but often It can cause various\\ncomplications such as hair growth, stenosis, stone formation, and diverticulum formation.\\nMoreover, because the materials are taken from their own tissues, they are often limited by the\\nsource of the donor material, and complications at the donor site are prone to occur. In the case of\\nend-stage organ failure, transplantation is usually used. Although transplantation technology is\\nrelatively mature, the results are not always satisfactory in terms of immune control and suppression\\nof complications. In addition, the number of organ donors in the country and the world is far below\\nthe demand for transplantation, and the population is gradually aging, and the number of people\\nwith reduced tissue and organ function is increasing. If the length of the ureter and urethra is large,\\nrepair, operations are sometimes difficult to perform. Therefore, to solve these problems, it is\\nnecessary to find a way to replace or regenerate damaged organs and tissues. The development of\\nregenerative medicine and tissue engineering allows people to further understand the mechanism of\\ntissue regeneration and find ways to regenerate damaged tissues or organs. It is now possible to\\nimprove tissue regeneration capacity or use biomaterial scaffolds combined with stem cells to repair\\ndamaged tissues and organs, to restore the functions of tissues and organs and improve the quality\\nof life of patients. This article reviews the achievements in basic research and clinical application of\\ntissue engineering technology in urology in recent years, to provide direction and guidance for\\nfuture research and innovation in this field.\\n\\n1|Page\\n\\x0c 2. Overview of urinary system tissue engineering\\n\\nTissue engineering is the science of constructing biological substitutes to maintain or repair\\ndamaged tissues and organs based on the principles of cell biology, materials science, and\\nbioengineering.\\n\\nThe cell sources of urinary system tissue engineering mainly include:\\n\\ne Original cells: obtained from oneself, cultured in vitro, and then used to repair damaged\\ntissue.\\n\\ne Urinary tract epithelial cells: Obtained through bladder biopsy and cell culture. The collection\\nmethod is invasive, but it is currently available. Urinary epithelial cells are separated by urine or\\nbladder washing.\\n\\ne Autologous epithelial cells, oral keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells (used to restore the\\ncontraction and urination function of the bladder).\\n\\ne Stem cells: bone marrow stem cells, adipose stem cells, urine-derived stem cells.\\n\\nThe scaffold materials for tissue engineering mainly include:\\n\\n1. Synthetic polymers, such as biodegradable polymers: polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid-\\npolyglycolic acid, both of which are biomaterial's composed of covalently bonded macromolecules.\\nThe main advantage of synthetic polymers is that they can produce organ structures of any shape in\\nthree-dimensional space, can be quantified, have good reproducibility, and are relatively low cost.\\nBecause it is an artificial material, there are no problems related to graft or autologous tissue\\ncollection damage. In addition, many characteristics of such synthetic polymers can be controlled,\\nsuch as porosity and mechanical properties; and can be degraded through hydrolytic pathways, and\\nthe residual debris can be eliminated through metabolic pathways; it does not contain any molecular\\nsignals related to guiding cell activity and differentiation, so it is more conducive to tissue and\\norgan repair.\\n\\n2. Biologically derived scaffolds are decolourized tissues based on chemical and mechanical\\nmeans, such as submucosa of the small intestine (SIS) and bladder acellular matrix (BAM). Due to\\nthe residual growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, they have the advantages like\\nthe inherent biological activity and mechanical properties of natural ECM. However, one of the\\nmain disadvantages of these stents is that the remaining protein composition and structure may be\\ndifferent from the body itself to be implanted. Most natural scaffolds come from pigs, so they may\\nbe a source of disease transmission. In addition, ethical issues will also affect its clinical use.\\n\\n3. Self-assembled engineering, tissue. This method utilizes or combines the self-assembly\\ncharacteristics of cells to construct a three-dimensional biological tissue structure. After\\ndecellularization and sterilization of biologically derived materials, the exogenous extracellular\\nmatrix material may still contain a considerable amount of DNA that may affect biocompatibility.\\nThe self-assembly method can produce tissues constructed by the cells themselves, in which the\\ndense extracellular matrix is produced entirely by their own fibroblasts. The biggest advantage of\\nthis material is that it eliminates the influence of the biocompatibility of exogenous materials. By\\nreducing the immune response, inflammation and fibrosis can be reduced, thereby increasing the\\nsuccess rate of surgery. In recent years, some of the techniques in these methods have been used in\\nthe reconstruction of urinary system tissues [1]. These techniques require cells to receive\\ncorresponding signals for proper differentiation, so that the engineered tissues for transplantation\\nand the target tissues for replacement can be exhausted. It may be similar. Studying and simulating\\nrelated signals is a difficult problem that needs to be overcome to apply these technologies to other\\n2|Page\\n\\x0c tissues and organs.\\n\\nIn addition, nowadays 3D printing technology has been widely used in various fields, including\\nnanoelectronics, medicine and tissue engineering. It can accurately combine different materials with\\ndifferent substrates, making it the best choice for carrying drugs and conducting personalized\\nmedical research. [2] Therefore, 3D printing technology has gradually become an important part of\\nthe construction of tissue engineering scaffolds.\\n\\n3. Application of tissue engineering technology in kidney\\n\\nThe main components used to construct a functional kidney structure in tissue engineering\\ntechnology are living cells, a scaffold system based on biometrics, biologically active factors, and\\nappropriate microenvironments that promote cell behavior. On this basis, the natural healing ability\\nof body regeneration is used to guide the growth of new organizations. The method is mainly to\\nseparate the donor tissue into individual cells. These cells are either directly implanted in the host\\nbody, or cultured and expanded and then implanted, or attached to a scaffold and expanded and then\\nimplanted [3].\\n\\nAs a good carrier for cell growth, collagen hydrogel has been widely used in the preparation of\\nkidney tissue engineering scaffolds. The three-dimensional collagen scaffold was used to\\nreconstruct three-dimensional kidney tissue in vitro using mixed newborn rat kidney cells, and it\\nwas found that the seed cells in the three-dimensional hydrogel scaffold could self-assemble into\\nengineered kidney tissue containing renal tubules and glomerulus-like structures and be cultured in\\nthree dimensions. The cells can retain their phenotype, migration ability and albumin uptake\\nfunction. Hydrogel hyaluronic acid (HA) can be used as a scaffold material for kidney tissue\\nengineering, but actual research and application have shown that hydrogel scaffolds and other\\nhydrogel polymer scaffolds are difficult to maintain due to low mechanical strength and physical\\nshape. This results in a higher failure rate during use. To improve the mechanical strength, there are\\nalso studies combining extracellular matrix derivatives with synthetic biomaterials. This composite\\nscaffold is considered a solid carrier in tissue engineering [4]. In terms of decellularized scaffolds,\\nthe researchers decellularized rat kidneys, implanted epithelial cells and endothelial cells to create\\ncell-containing scaffolds, then perused the cell-containing scaffolds in a director, and finally\\nimplanted them in the body. The bioengineered kidney after transplantation can produce urine and\\nremove metabolites in the body [5].\\n\\nIn addition to the above research, another main reason that bioengineered organs can achieve\\nlong-term good results in the body is a potency of blood vessels. In the case that the vascular matrix\\nis not completely fused with endothelial cells, there is likely to be obvious thrombosis in the\\nvascular system of the stent, which makes the revascularized structure lose its function. To solve\\nthis problem, Ko et al. [6] Adopted an endothelial cell inoculation method that can effectively cover\\nthe blood vessel wall of the decellularized pig kidney stent. The study of Lertkiatmongkol et al. [7]\\nShowed that the combination of CD31 antibody and vascular matrix enables vascular endothelial\\ncells to attach to blood vessels. CD31 is also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1\\n(PECAM-1/CD31).). Therefore, in future research, we can try to use endothelial cell inoculation\\nmethod and combine with antibody to effectively improve the adhesion and retention of endothelial\\ncells, and further investigate whether this method can make the engineered renal blood vessels\\nunobstructed.\\n\\nMachiguchi et al. [8] Used cell-cell interactions in conditioned media to generate neurons in the\\nbody for kidney repair. Their research proved the inhibitory effect of collecting duct cell matrix of\\n\\n3|Page\\n\\x0c vascular endothelial cells and renal tubular epithelial cells, as well as the stimulating interaction\\nbetween vascular endothelial cells and renal tubular epithelial cells. Since the collecting duct cell\\nmatrix is like the renal tubular epithelial cell matrix, it can cause mesenchymal stem cells to\\ndifferentiate into renal tubular epithelial cells. Therefore, renal tubular epithelial cells differentiated\\nfrom mesenchymal stem cells induced by the collecting duct cell matrix can be injected into the rat\\nrenal cortex. Compared with unprotected cells, pre-implantation of cells with a small amount of gel\\ncomplex for three-dimensional culture pretreatment can trigger the formation of more neoprene-like\\nstructures, indicating that the pre-treated kidney is injected into the renal cortex. Tubular epithelial\\ncells may help repair dysfunctional kidney tissue. Zhang et al. [9] Used adipose stem cells to\\ndifferentiate into mesoderm and implanted into stents, and then recellularized the renal artery and\\nureter. They found that the induced mesoderm cells differentiated into tubular cells and products\\nmore efficiently than adipose stem cells. This will provide a new idea for the differentiation and\\ninduction of seed cells in the future.\\n\\nIn order to make the above technology feasible in clinical transformation, other key technical\\nproblems need to be solved, including manufacturing a cell-free renal scaffold with clinical scale\\n[10]; using clinically sourced cells to effectively recellularize the scaffold for reconstruction Fully\\nfunctional kidney structure; reduce the cycle of cultivating engineered kidney; ensure that there is\\nno serious thrombosis in the long-term implant. In addition, the clinical application of fully\\nfunctional kidneys in kidney-specific diseases are still a challenging task. To achieve this goal,\\nmultidisciplinary research in this field should be carried out in a balanced manner, including the\\nestablishment of kidney disease models, preclinical research on the construction and application of\\ntissue engineering kidneys, treatment methods for immune problems, and the regulation of\\ninnervation of implants. The function of the kidney is complex, and the structure is diverse. It is still\\ndifficult to completely reconstruct an engineered kidney that can be used for transplantation by\\ntissue engineering in vitro. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to select and optimize to produce\\nengineered kidneys in future research. The cells, scaffold materials and culture, the environment are\\nused to make engineered kidneys that function closer to normal kidneys and can be used for\\ntransplantation.\\n\\n4. Application of tissue engineering technology in ureter\\n\\nAcellular matrix is a kind of tissue engineering ureteral scaffold, especially when it is planted\\nwith cells, it can increase the formation of blood vessels. Koch et al. [11] Proposed to use porcine\\nacellular matrix cross-linked ureter as a scaffold for human arterial wall regeneration. The results of\\nthe study found that the smooth muscle cells inoculated within 2 weeks evenly filled the stent,\\nmaking the stent a substitute for the ureter for transplantation. To improve the regeneration effect,\\nZhao et al. [12] Proposed the method of implanting mesenchymal stem cells between vascular\\nendothelial cells to bridge the long arterial gap. The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells can\\nobtain multi-layered arterial tissue. In smooth muscle tissue stained with a-smooth muscle actin and\\nsmooth muscle myosin heavy chain, urothelial cytokeratin 20 and write-in 11 were positively\\nexpressed, which proves that this technology is useful in tissue engineering arterial repair.\\nApplication prospects clinically, the treatment methods for arterial stenosis or injury are mainly\\ninsertion of a double J tube, balloon expansion, repair, and skin fistula. The application of tissue\\nengineering technology will greatly improve the quality of life of patients who have to fistula, such\\nas the ureter that cannot be repaired or has long defects. Clinically, the standard method of\\nreplacement therapy is tubular small intestine replacement therapy or tongue mucosal replacement\\n\\n4|Page\\n\\x0c therapy, but due to many complications, it is difficult to achieve the expected clinical treatment\\neffect. Another pioneering research is the use of veins instead of ureters [13]. The vein is a pipeline\\nfor the transportation of fluid in the human body. It has good elasticity and is very close to the ureter\\nin function. However, the number of animals in this study is small, and the incidence of\\nhydronephrosis is still increasing 3 months after transplantation, and the effect is not very\\nsatisfactory. Further studies need to have good long-term results before they have the chance to be\\napplied in clinical practice in the future.\\n\\nIn the future application of tissue engineering technology, the concept of vein replacement in the\\nabove method can be combined, and the decellularized vein can be used as a stent to plant arterial\\nepithelial cells and smooth muscle cells on the stent to achieve the function of replacing the ureter.\\nThe location of the ureter is deep, and the injuries are mostly iatrogenic. The patients with long\\nstenosis are often older and have a higher tolerance to conventional treatment. Therefore, the\\napplicability of tissue engineering technology for the treatment of arterial stenosis lacks effective\\nclinical practice. Research.\\n\\n5. Application of tissue engineering technology in the bladder\\n\\nThe materials for bladder tissue engineering mainly include:\\n\\n1. Biomaterial's: natural biological materials made of collagen and alginate and cellular tissue\\nmatrices made of different types of tissues from pigs, such as the submucosa of the bladder, the\\nsubmucosa of the small intestine, the dermis, Bladder, gallbladder, and amniotic fluid tissue, etc.\\n[14].\\n\\n2. Artificial materials: synthetic stents (polyethylene sponge, Teflon, etc.); synthetic polymers\\n(such as poly- 4 -ester); silk-based materials. These materials have the advantages of non-toxicity,\\nbiodegradability, and easy adjustment of their structure. Among them, the silk-based sourcing has\\nbeen removed from the silk biological material, and the human body’s tolerance to the silk-based\\nmaterial is equivalent to that of the biological material, so the silk-based material can be used as a\\nscaffold in tissue engineering technology. In addition, Shakhssalim et al. [15] Successfully applied\\nelectrospinning technology to prepare a polycaprolactone/polylactic acid scaffold for canine bladder\\nwall replacement. Cell matrix was added to support seed detrusor smooth muscle cells, which can\\nstimulate local in vivo growth of primary cells.\\n\\nIn terms of cell selection, in theory, autologous cells are the best choice for inducing tissue\\nfusion and regeneration, which can effectively avoid serious immune responses. However, if urine-\\nderived stem cells are collected at the source of autologous cells, they are not suitable for urinary\\ndiversion. The main reason for patients undergoing urinary diversion surgery is that most of the\\npatients undergoing urinary diversion surgery are mostly suffering from tumorous diseases, so the\\ncollected cell sources may contain tumor cells. Other studies have shown that in vitro neuropathic\\nbladder cells (smooth muscle and epithelial cells) have low contractile potential and low\\nproliferation and differentiation ability [16]. Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells seem to be a good\\nsource of cells in bladder tissue engineering. However, since mesenchymal stem cells are not\\nautologous bladder cells, they are easily altered by urinary toxicity, which may affect the success\\nrate of tissue regeneration, but their advantage is that mesenchymal stem cells seem not to be\\naffected by the initial pathology of the nervous system [17]. Studies have proved that the use of\\nmultiple cell co-transplantation can promote the regeneration of bladder tissue [18]. However,\\ninsufficient vascularization of regenerated bladder tissue is still a challenge for bladder tissue\\nengineering. Zhao et al. [19] Isolated adipose-derived endothelial progenitor cells with high\\n\\n5|Page\\n\\x0c proliferation potential and angiogenic properties, pretreated with hypoxia to increase the activity of\\nstem cells, and then combined porcine bladder acellular matrix with hypoxia-pretreated autologous\\nadipose-derived endothelial progenitor cells were injected into the rat bladder reconstruction model\\nat the same time, and its feasibility and the possibility of bladder blood vessel formation were\\nevaluated, proving that hypoxia preconditioning can promote angiogenesis and tissue-engineered\\nbladder function recovery.\\n\\nClinically, the ideal replacement bladder has complicated complications. The materials used for\\nbladder reconstruction in the past included gelatin sponge, Japanese paper, formalin-preserved dog\\nbladder, freeze-dried human dura mater, bovine pericardium, and small intestinal submucosa [20].\\nThese biological materials provide a temporary scaffold for tissue growth, and over time they will\\nreshape and degrade. A common complication in patients with bladder reconstruction is the gradual\\ndecrease in bladder capacity. Therefore, although these batteries can benefit some patients, they are\\nrarely used in subsequent studies due to their poor long-term effects and the existence of\\ncomplications. Be used again. To construct a tissue-engineered bladder, Bouhout et al. [21]\\nSimulated an autologous bladder equivalent (VE). First, fibroblasts and epithelial cells were used\\nfor three-dimensional culture to obtain reconstructed VE; then they were cultured in a bioreactor,\\nthe reactor can provide a circulating pressure of up to 15 cm H2O0, which is then rapidly reduced to\\nachieve dynamically cultured VE (DCVE). The study found that the contour of the urothelium\\nproduced by dynamic culture was like that of the natural bladder. Permeability analysis showed that\\nits contour was like that of the natural bladder and consistent with the basal cell tissue of the\\nbladder. At the same time, it had the proper stretch ability during suture and processing. This new\\nalternative method provides a new direction for regenerative medicine, which has similar properties\\nto the bladder and can act as a urea barrier. These properties can significantly reduce inflammation,\\nnecrosis, and possible rejection. Studies have shown that, compared with cell-free scaffolds, cells\\nare implanted into scaffolds (such as: bladder acellular matrix; polyacetic acid/polylactic acid-\\nglycolic acid), the effect of cell growth is better [22-23]. In clinical trials, it was found that a\\ncellular scaffold can only regenerate the urothelium but cannot regenerate smooth muscles to\\nachieve the effect of restoring the contractile function of the bladder. Another study by Bouhout et\\nal. [24] Found that the use of collagen-derived scaffolds in tissue-engineered three-dimensional\\nspherical bladder models can mimic the natural shape of the bladder. Bladder mesenchymal cells\\nare embedded in the scaffold, and epithelial cells are implanted on the surface. Therefore, the\\ntension in the bladder mesenchymal cells and epithelial cells implanted in the model are like that in\\nnatural tissues. The three-dimensional spherical bladder model has the characteristics of highly\\nmature urethral epithelium, collagen remodeling, and smooth muscle cells expressing myosin show\\na tendency to rearrange parallel to the surface of the cavity, which has characteristics comparable to\\nnatural tissues. This technology can be used for Partial replacement therapy for pathological bladder\\nin the future.\\n\\nThe ideal tissue engineering, regeneration biomaterial should be able to make the mature\\nepithelial cell layer uniformly and continuously attach to the surface of the bladder cavity and form\\nmultiple smooth muscle cell layers on the surface of the bladder cavity. It should also provide\\nsufficient mechanical support to prevent renewal in the body. The tissue collapses prematurely\\nbefore it forms. However, the implanted cells are suddenly exposed to an environment full of\\ninflammatory mediators and activated immune responses, which will significantly affect their\\nproliferation and function. Therefore, the constructed in vivo microenvironment should support the\\nself-renewal, survival and differentiation of the implanted cell population and protect it from\\n\\n6|Page\\n\\x0c\""]},"execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["article_txt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"unUt1x0_nqJj"},"source":["## Text
